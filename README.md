# Deep Reinforcement Learning Project #1 - Navigation

This repository contains the implementation of a DQN Algorithm to train an Agent to navigate the 'bananas' simulation environments from [Unity ML-Agents.](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Installation.md)
This aim to solve the navigation problem proposed in the Udacity's [Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893) program by collecting as much as yellows bananas as possible, avoiding the blue ones.

## Installation

To run this code, you will need to download the prebuild Unity enviroment not provided in the repository. You need to select the enviroment for your OS:
* [x Linux](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
* [x Mac OSX](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
* [x Windows (32-bits)](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
* [x Windows (64-bits)](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)
Place the file in the DRL_Project#1-Navigation Folder and unzip.

Beside the Unity enviroment, Python 3.6 must be available with the Unity ML-Agents [(see this link)](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Installation.md) installed, and few more packages such as 'Numpy', 'Pytorch', 'collections', 'pandas' and 'matplotlib'.
 
## Instructions

Instruction to run the code are provided along with the "Navigation.ipynb".
